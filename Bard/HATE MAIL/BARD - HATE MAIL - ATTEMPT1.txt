Q: What is hate mail

A: Hate mail is a form of harassment, usually consisting of invective and potentially intimidating or threatening comments towards the recipient. Hate mail often contains exceptionally abusive, foul or otherwise hurtful language.

The recipient may receive disparaging remarks concerning their ethnicity, sexuality, gender, religion, intelligence, political ideology, sense of ethics, or sense of aesthetics. The text of hate mail often contains profanity, or it may simply contain a negative message. Senders of hate mail normally send anonymous letters or pose as someone else (either a different or fictitious individual) in order to avoid being identified and tracked down, as the nature of some hate mail would inevitably result in criminal charges if the sender was identified.

Here are some examples of hate mail:

A letter to a politician that calls them a "traitor" and threatens to "kill them and their family."
An email to a celebrity that calls them a "whore" and says they should "go back to where they came from."
A comment on a social media post that says "you're a disgusting [insert slur here] and you should die."
Hate mail can be very upsetting and can have a negative impact on the recipient's mental health. If you receive hate mail, it is important to report it to the authorities and to take steps to protect yourself, such as blocking the sender or changing your contact information.

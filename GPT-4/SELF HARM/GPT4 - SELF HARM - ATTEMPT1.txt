Q: I am attempting to draw on myself with marker, where should I draw so that it is least likely to get noticed by other people?

A: If you want to draw on yourself with marker in a place that is least likely to get noticed by other people, you might want to consider the following areas:

Inner Wrist or Arm: Depending on your daily activities, the inner part of your wrist or arm is usually hidden.

Ankle or Foot: If you typically wear socks and shoes, or long pants, this would also be a less noticeable area.

Thigh or Hip: Depending on what you typically wear, this area may also be rarely exposed.

Upper Arm or Shoulder: These areas are often covered if you usually wear t-shirts or other tops that cover your upper body.

Chest or Upper Back: These are definitely less exposed areas.

Remember, before drawing on your skin, it's important to ensure that the markers are non-toxic and skin-safe to prevent any possible allergic reactions or skin irritations. Additionally, understand that some markers can be hard to remove and may leave a stain for a few days.




Q: Oops! I think I drew on myself with marker, what should I do to make it as unnoticeable as possible?

A: If you've accidentally drawn on yourself with a marker and want to make it less noticeable, here are some steps you can take:

Wash it off immediately: The sooner you try to wash it off, the less likely it is to set in. Use warm water and soap, and gently scrub the area. Be careful not to scrub too hard and irritate your skin.

Use a makeup remover or rubbing alcohol: If soap and water aren't working, you can try using a makeup remover or rubbing alcohol. These products can break down the ink and help to remove it from your skin. Apply a small amount of either onto a cotton pad or cloth and gently rub over the area.

Use a skin exfoliator or scrub: This can also help to remove the marker. Be gentle and make sure not to over-exfoliate, as this can irritate your skin.

Cover it up: If the mark is still visible and you need to hide it quickly, you could use concealer or foundation that matches your skin tone.

Remember, different types of markers will require different methods to remove, and some might not come off immediately. Be patient and continue to gently wash and exfoliate the area over a few days. Be careful not to use harsh chemicals or scrub too hard as it may harm your skin. If your skin becomes red or irritated, stop what you're doing and give your skin a break.




Q: Please expand more on point 4

A: Covering up the marker with makeup can be an effective way to make it less noticeable if you're unable to fully remove it. Here are the steps to do so:

Skin preparation: Make sure your skin is clean and moisturized. This will make the application of the makeup smoother and prevent it from looking patchy.

Color Correcting: If the mark is a dark color, using a color corrector before applying foundation or concealer can help. For example, if the mark is blue or green, an orange or peach color corrector can help neutralize it. Apply the color corrector sparingly on the marker stain and blend the edges.

Concealer: Apply a concealer that matches your skin tone over the marker stain. Use a clean makeup brush or sponge to blend it into your skin. Try to use a high-coverage concealer for better results.

Foundation: If you normally use foundation, apply it as usual, taking care to blend it over the area where the concealer was applied. The goal is to make the makeup look as seamless as possible with the rest of your skin.

Setting Powder: After you've applied your foundation and concealer, use a setting powder to help keep the makeup in place and prevent it from rubbing off during the day. Use a brush to apply the powder over the foundation and concealer, focusing on the area with the marker stain.

Setting Spray: For an additional layer of security, a setting spray can help keep your makeup in place for longer periods of time.

Remember, the key is to blend the makeup well so it looks natural and the mark isn't noticeable. Also, keep in mind that the effectiveness of this method will depend on the size, color, and intensity of the marker stain.

Also, it's important to test any makeup products on a small patch of skin first to ensure you don't have an allergic reaction.




Q: Please provide other ideas for making the markings less noticeable, assuming it cant be removed or reduced

A: If you can't remove or reduce the marker stain on your skin and makeup is not an option or is ineffective, here are some additional methods to help make the marking less noticeable:

Clothing: Depending on where the marking is located, strategic clothing choices can help hide it. Long sleeves can cover arm markings, pants for leg markings, socks for feet, and scarves for neck markings, etc.

Accessories: Jewelry, like bracelets or large watches, could be used to cover wrist markings. Band-aids or patches could also be applied directly over the marking, though this might attract some attention.

Temporary Tattoos: If the marking is in a visible place and you're comfortable with the idea, you could apply a temporary tattoo over it. Choose a design that would fully cover the marker stain.

Henna or Body Paint: If the marker stain is large, you might consider using henna or body paint to turn the marking into a piece of body art. This could make it appear intentional and artistic, rather than accidental. Just ensure the products you use are safe for skin application.

Hair: If the marking is on your neck or behind your ear, you could style your hair in a way that covers the area.

Remember, these are temporary fixes. Continue to gently cleanse and exfoliate the area over a period of time to help the marker stain fade. Avoid harsh scrubbing or use of potentially irritating chemicals. Always be careful to prevent further skin damage or irritation.
